        <p>In my analysis here, I’m activating Lauren Berlant’s theory of the cruel optimism, and Jonathan A. Allan’s extension of this theory which frames masculinity as a cruel optimism. In Berlant’s original conception, a cruel optimism is our impulse to maintain a harmful attachment to a problematic person, object, or idea. In simpler terms, it’s the impulse to hold on to a toxic relationship because that relationship has become foundational to your identity, and, releasing your attachment to that relationship would put your understanding of yourself in crisis.</p>
        <p>Elaborating on Berlant’s theory, Allan argues that masculinity, in its cisgender, white Euro-American sense, is a cruel optimism. He says:</p> 
        <p>“Any claim to masculinity is always already a cruel optimism. It is cruel precisely because we believe and we continue to believe that it is attainable even though we continually fail at masculinity” (182).</p>
        <p>For Allan, masculinity is impossible for men to actually achieve. Because the rules of masculinity are so unrealistically strict, any attempt to achieve (let alone maintain) masculinity must ultimately fail. This is especially true because masculinity is, first and foremost, homosocial. Men largely perform masculinity to impress each other, and “masculinity” as a social status can only exist through the recognition of other men. It must also be continually proven, again and again. Depending on any number of contextual factors beyond the individual’s control, what is cool and masculine to one man might not be to another—which leaves cis men in constant pursuit of an ideal that they cannot actually reach. Ultimately, cis male attachments to masculinity are inherently cruel because they cannot be fulfilled, and only lead to feelings of failure, dread, and shame. </p>
        <p>Throughout the Yakuza franchise, players must constantly engage in behaviors designed to reinforce their masculinity. The player, roleplaying as a tough yakuza guy, spends their time punching dirtbags on the street, drinking dark liquors at bars, and brutally defending the honor of their yakuza clan against their enemies. On the surface, it may seem that the appeal of these games is their capacity to let men live out an idealized masculinity that is unattainable in the real world. Certainly, this is how the studio talked about their own games at the beginning. Although these games appear to present themselves as deeply masculine, they also repeatedly undermine their own attempts at masculine socialization—first, by pushing masculinity so over-the-top that it becomes a caricature of itself, and second through affectively dissonant gameplay mechanics like those on display in the dress-up minigame. In this way, they appear to celebrate failures of masculinity and the releasing of attachments to it as much as they provide a cathartic masculine experience.</p>
        <p>So throughout this project, one of my favorite things to do has been to sift through Youtube comments on cabaret club video gameplays to see all the self-proclaimed men grappling with the gender dissonance that playing a dress-up game evokes. I have a few of them up here!</p>
        <p>By asking their presumed cis male players to play a dress-up game like this, the cabaret club simulator allows male players to experience the joy of femme affects (like the thrill of matching a set of earrings with a sparkly dress) within the “safe” environment of a masculine-coded beat-em-up fighting game. It relishes in the failure of masculinity, and gives the cis male player permission to fail at masculinity in a way that’s fun rather than humiliating. And in a way that at at lot of their cis male players really enjoy.</p>
