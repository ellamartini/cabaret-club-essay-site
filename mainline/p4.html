        I credit the speed and quality of the studio’s output to two main philosophies: (1) reuse assets whenever possible, and (2) rip off every video game in existence. A lot of people like to throw these things around as insults leveled at any good studio’s integrity. You’re not supposed to admit to copying someone else (or to copying yourself, I guess). It’s derivative. It’s lazy. But I stand in awe of RGG’s genius. I am not one of these weak-minded gamers who thinks that developers need to throw everything out after a single use, or [reinvent the wheel] just to make something worthwhile. I want my games to hold history. I want to look at an Ijincho storefront’s black and white tiles, go Ah those are the same tiles from the disco club!!! and think fondly back to all the hours I spent slamming through “Koi No Disco Queen” until a twenty four year-old Majima was finally crowned the Disco Queen of Sotenbori (for 1988–I can’t claim that he maintained the title on his own without my help). I want to experience things like this that make me giddy with joy. I want games to hold my history.

        [transition here] As a team operating under SEGA Entertainment, they certainly have direct access to scores of video game history.

        The studio has held on to the same protagonist for the better part of twenty years. They have made [number here] games about Kiryu’s exploits, set in literally the same Kamurocho map. I know this digital map better than I know my own neighborhood. I could navigate Kabukicho in real life due to how many hours I’ve spent in this map. I’ve seen Kiryu and Kamurocho change (and remain the same) across twenty years of real time, moving from phone booths to pagers to iPhones. As I walk down random alleyways in Yakuza 3, I say to myself “Hey that massage parlor is in the space that Kiryu ran his real estate empire out of in his twenties (Yakuza 0)” or “Dude this ramen shop has been in business since at least 1988 and its owner literally hasn’t aged (Yakuza 0 to present).” (Reusing assets at its finest.)
