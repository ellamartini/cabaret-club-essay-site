        Anyone who has talked to me in the past few years will know that basically all I do anymore is think and write about the <i>Like A Dragon</i> franchise—think, write, and <i>play</i>, obviously. According to my Xbox, I played just about <span id="yirHours">737 hours</span> of pure <i>Yakuza</i> in 2024. That might seem like a lot for what the games are, but when you add up all the time I spent teaching myself how to play mahjong or comparing sidewalk textures across the studio’s different game engines, it starts to make sense. During <i>Yakuza 6</i> I got really into <i>walking</i>. As in walking around. The map. Instead of running. The hours add up quickly.

        I say this not just to set up my own personal expertise on this very cool topic, but to emphasize that above all, <i>I am a huge fan of these games</i>. I am a <i>Yakuza</i> fan first and media scholar second. And although there is certainly plenty of media theory (and otherwise) here, I'm not going to hit you with some explicit argument about the state of modern video games. I want to walk you through the streets of Kamurocho. I want you to see through my eyes. Click through my neural pathways. Become a girl who loves things through the internet. Regardless of whether or not anyone can actually <i>know</i> someone else's experience (I'm not going to answer this question here), I do want you to know mine. Consider this the <span id="welcomeMatSpan">welcome mat.</span>

        Now I'm going to provide some cool <i>Yakuza</i> context for everyone who <i>hasn't</i> spent over a thousand hours in these games. Choose your path:

        <div class="navArrow" id="button4" onclick="window.location.href='p1.1.html'">
            <p>I already know what <i>Yakuza</i> is</p>

        Gamer credentials in case you thought I was lying. It was actually definitely more than this because I know that it <i>at least</i> didn't log like 50 hours of <i>Yakuza 5</i> when my Xbox was offline. I'm not proud of it.
