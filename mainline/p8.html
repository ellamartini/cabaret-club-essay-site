        On top of it’s actual gameplay elements, the minigame also features an inexplicably robust system for customizing your platinum hostesses’ outfits. And I mean robust. The developers of this game made literally hundreds of style options for their players to choose from, including hairstyles, hair colors, earrings, necklaces, bracelets, watches, rings, nails, and of course dresses—each of which comes in about ten different colors and variations. As you mix and match different accessories, your choices create different stat bonuses that boost the hostess’ gameplay abilities. The player can also choose from over fifty different makeup options, despite the fact that makeup has no effect on the hostess’ stats. That is just purely in there for fun. Considering that the studio openly makes games for a young male audience, what is going on here? Why did they do all of this?

        This question has guided my research surrounding the cabaret club simulator. But, rather than trying to prove author intent on behalf of the developers, I’m more interested in how the feminine affects generated through the dress-up simulator resonate with self-described male players.
