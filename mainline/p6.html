        <p>introduce the game (nothing about the dress up yet)</p>
        <p>Nowhere is this magic better on display than in Yakuza 0’s Cabaret Club Czar. In it, you play as protagonist Goro Majima who decides to help manage a failing cabaret club on the brink of closure. The player must recruit hostesses from around town, then train them for the job by going on practice dates and leveling up their stats through a fast-paced management simulator. Gameplay consists of matching hostesses from your roster to guests based on their unique strengths and what each guest is looking for. A customer is looking for a sexy girl who can party? You might put in Miss Isobe, the (recently dethroned) Disco Queen of Sotenbori. That mega-rich guy wants someone to talk to? Send him Etsuko, the loud old woman in the cheetah-print pullover whose base “talk” stat is completely maxed out, then watch as dollars bills literally erupt out of him and scatter across the club floor.</p>
        <p>[FOOTNOTE: Which is not as romantic as you might think—Majima never expresses any actual attraction toward them and pretty much all of them insist that they don’t see Majima as a “man”…okay??? 🤨🏳️‍🌈]</p>
