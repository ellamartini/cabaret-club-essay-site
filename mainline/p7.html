        Cabaret Club Czar is a true fan favorite, consistently ranking at the top of “Best Yakuza Minigames” lists across the internet—for good reason. I lost countless hours to this relatively simple business simulator, which is I guess fun in the way that “number go up” games like this or Candy Crush or the stock market are fun for moms and finance bros respectively. All this to say, the minigame is a beloved piece of the franchise, and I’m far from the first person to comment on its splendor. Cabaret Club Czar changed my life—but, not for any of the reasons mentioned so far. It’s gameplay is deliciously satisfying. The story woven throughout it rules. The hostesses are all written to have so much personality, wit, and humanity, that by the end of it I felt like they were all <i>my</i> (Ella’s) best friends. No, what I want to talk about here is an overlooked and under-discussed piece of the Cabaret Club Czar minigame: its dress-up mechanics.
