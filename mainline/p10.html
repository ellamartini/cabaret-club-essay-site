        The thing that I love most about Yakuza games is that their affects are so intensely physical. If they had an essence, it would be a hard punch square in the solar plexus. I feel them in my body. And I have never, ever had a more intense physical response to a video game than when I played the cabaret club simulator for the first time. I asked earlier, if the studio makes games for cis men, who is this dress-up minigame for? Well, <i>it’s for me.</i></p>

        Whether or not RGG was thinking of me when they made Cabaret Club Czar (I doubt it), this game was tailor made for me specifically. It was embedded in my bones before I’d even discovered it, implanted there by twinkling nail polish animations and Flash player. The first time that I ventured into the dress-up editor—sitting alone on my couch, in the dark of midnight, the cool blue light of the TV illuminating my living room—it quietly brought me to tears. I couldn’t believe that a modern AAA video game would hold my girlhood self so tenderly, much less an ultra-violent fighting game about organized criminals. I looked at the style menus and the young woman modeled on my TV, and I saw myself there. In the sparkle animations. In the digital gowns. In the twinkling sound effect that triggered as I toggled between hairstyles. I was unraveling at the hands of a Barbie dress-up game rendered on my Xbox. </p>

        I thought to myself, is this what video games are like for men? Which is probably half true, and half not. They see themselves represented in games all the time—not just in the characters on their screen, but in the mechanics that they engage with. I assume the love affair that male developers seem to have with shooters and military combat simulators often traces back to some early fantasy they had with “boy” toys and action movies. A lot of the boys in my elementary school did learn how to roll their r’s by mimicking the sound of machine guns. (Despite the cumulative <i>decade</i> of Spanish classes I’ve taken since the third grade, I’ve never been able to match them on this front.)
