        <p> Here we are on Tenkaichi St., Kamurocho's #1 spot for watching a yakuza steal your bike and smash it through the sliding glass doors of a Poppo.</p>
        
        <p>If you don't know what <span id="yakuzaSpan"><i>Yakuza</i>*</span> is and you've been wildly confused so far, all you really need to know is that these are (mostly) action beat-em-up games where you roleplay as a tough Japanese yakuza guy who solves problems by taking his shirt off and <span id="muscle">punching other men.</span> The franchise was originally conceived in 2005 as a sort-of unofficial video game adaptation of Takashi Miikeâ€™s yakuza films, and over the following twenty years have followed the same cast of characters through tales of friendship, brotherhood, gang politics, fatherhood, grand-fatherhood(?), nuclear waste disposal?, and of course, pirates.</p>

        <p>I'm going to flip flop between using <i>Yakuza</i> and <i>Like A Dragon</i> as the title of the franchise based on whatever makes sense in the moment. In my defense, the studio also does this.</p>
