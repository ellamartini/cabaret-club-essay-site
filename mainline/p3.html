        <p>In a world plagued by boring video games, the existence of the Like A Dragon franchise feels like something of a miracle. Other studios [get bogged down] chasing things like photorealistic graphics and the next highest-possible frame rate only to forget to make their game fun. Meanwhile, RGG pops open their twenty-year-old asset library, starts slapping blurry JPEGs onto buildings with an attitude that says “eh, it’s good enough” and goes what if we made an FMV version of The Bachelor? [link] Then they spend six months working on that, release it to wild acclaim, and move on to the next thing. [It’s not just that they release so many games so quickly, it’s that they consistently release the most fun games of the modern era.]</p>
