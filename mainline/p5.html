        <p>RGG’s games are not just their own—<i>they are everything</i>.</p>
        <p>The franchise is known for its minigames. Did you know that in <i>Infinite Wealth</i>, you can play RGG-made versions of <i>Animal Crossing</i>, <i>Pokémon</i>, AND <i>Crazy Taxi?</i> Probably, because that’s one of the first things that people say about it. Not anything about the main plot of the game or its mechanics—they say “Dude <i>Infinite Wealth?</i> There’s <i>Animal Crossing</i> IN. IT.” This isn’t to discredit anyone who does this. I do this. It is, frankly, unhinged that the studio built an entire <i>Animal Crossing</i> clone where you build a resort town using RGG’s own asset library, invite all your good friends from the franchise’s history to vacation there, and oh, by the way, it’s <i>completely optional</i>. A lesser studio would force you to play something that they spent so much time and money on. But RGG is better than that. Plus, it’s so good, they know you’ll choose to spend twenty hours of your life on it anyway.</p>

        Amidst the franchise’s long and rich minigame history, a few of the standouts include: karaoke, competitive slot car racing (against children), strip table tennis, underwater spearfishing, and a phone-dating game where you attempt to shoot words and phrases swirling through Kiryu’s mind-palace to keep him from fumbling his words in front of girls.

        Mark Twain once said that there are no new ideas. What I’m trying to say here is that if Mark Twain were still alive, he would also have 737 hours of Yakuza games logged on his Xbox. [transition here] RGG embraces their references with open arms. They don’t try to hide that they copied Animal Crossing, they just say “Yeah, we put an Animal Crossing clone in our game because we love Animal Crossing. It’s awesome.”

        [The magic on display here is] RGG imbuing things that they love with their signature yakuza brand. They ask, for instance, what if instead of a town full of cute animals, the lead character of Animal Crossing was a burly yakuza guy, and the resort island he built was full of gambling halls, cheap restaurants, and strip clubs? What if the fighters you collected in Pokémon were petty criminals and dirtbags that you cleaned off the streets of Hawaii? Who you then kept on an island, where they spend all day working out and gardening, waiting for you to visit so that you can give them gifts and rub their bellies? (Obviously, this increases your friendship bond with them and boosts their fighter stats.)
